BigBrainWarp
====================

BigBrain is a singular dataset that offers an ultra-high-resolution (20Âµm) volumetric reconstruction of a sliced and stained post-mortem human brain (Amunts et al. 2013). BigBrainWarp aims to enable integration of BigBrain with neuroimaging and other neurobiological modalities, helping a wide range of neuroscientists to utilise the cytoarchitectural information encoded in BigBrain for multi-scale neuroscientific discovery.

In the toolbox, youâ€™ll find preprocessed BigBrain data, scripts to transform between BigBrain and standard MRI spaces, and a selection of histology-derived feature maps already transformed to MRI space.

Additionally, weâ€™ve created a series of tutorials that illustrate potential workflows for BigBrain-MRI integration.

ðŸš§ The toolbox and readthedocs are still under construction. If you're interested in certain features or data, please get in touch and we can let you know whether it's finalised and provide the most up to date version.
